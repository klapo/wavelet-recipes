[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/klapo/wavelet-recipes/HEAD?filepath=notebooks)

Cookbooks for continuous wavelet and biwavelet analysis based on the pycwt libraries. Launch the interactive notebooks through the binder link above. Note that the large size of data used will usually crash the binder notebooks towards the end of the notebooks without manually clearing variables. Monte-Carlo simulations in the biwavelet-significance notebook will run slowly as well.

# Example applications

An example of the application of these recipes for detecting Internal Gravity Waves in Distributed Temperature Data is shown in my [EGU 2021 presentation](presentations/wavelet-application-example_IGW-EGU-2021.pdf).
