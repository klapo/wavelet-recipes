[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/klapo/wavelet-recipes/HEAD?filepath=notebooks)

Cookbooks for continuous wavelet and biwavelet analysis based on the pycwt libraries. Launch the interactive notebooks through the binder link above. Note that the Monte-Carlo simulations in the biwavelet-significance notebook will run slowly.

# Example applications

An example of the application of these recipes for detecting Internal Gravity Waves in Distributed Temperature Data is shown in my [EGU 2021 presentation](wavelets/presentations/wavelet-applicaiton-example_IGW-EGU-2021.pdf).
